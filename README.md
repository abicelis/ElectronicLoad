# ATmega328P (Arduino UNO) Electronic Load #

This ATmega328P-based electronic load is capable of loading power supplies (Batteries, Wallwarts, you name it). It's modes are:

* Constant Current
* Constant Resistance
* Constant Power
* Configurable Pulse Current
* Configurable Triangle Current	(Coming soon!)
* Configurable Sine Current (Coming soon!)


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Bill of materials ###
